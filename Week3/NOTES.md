# Week 3 Notes

> *Churn means to stop using a service*

- Churn Prediction project will help predicting whether a customer is likely to stop  i.e., churn using the services offered by a company.

- The prediction can give output between 0 and 1. The closer the prediction is to 1, the more likely is the customer churn prediction

- **Mutual Information**: Mutual information is a numerical measure telling how much can be known about a variable if we know the value of some other variable

- **Correlation**: Correlation is a numerical measure to know how two variables (e.g, x and y) are related to/dependent on each other. 
    - Correlation values ranges from -1 to 1. 
    - Value of 1 or closer means that the correlation is positively strong and change in one variable brings a positive change in the other variable.
    - Value of 0 or closer means that the correlation is neutral and change in one variable does not bring any change in the other variable
    - Value of -1 or closer means that the corelation is negatively strong and change in one variable brings a negative change in the other variable. 
    
- **One Hot Encoding**: One hot encoding is a way of representing categorical values in binary form (numerical values). This is done by creating a column for each unique value in the categorical feature and filling the newly created columns with either 1 or 0 based on the actual value present in the categorical feature.
